**AI that thinks more like humans do.**

ThoughtMCP gives AI systems human-like thinking capabilities. Instead of just processing text, it can think systematically, remember experiences, and check its own reasoning quality.

> **üöÄ Production Ready**: 789 tests, 79.63% coverage, stable API, ready for real-world use.

## What Makes It Different?

Most AI systems process text once and respond. ThoughtMCP implements multiple thinking systems inspired by cognitive science:

### üß† **Human-Like Thinking**

- **Fast intuitive responses** for familiar problems
- **Careful deliberation** for complex decisions
- **Creative exploration** for innovation challenges
- **Analytical reasoning** for technical problems

### üíæ **Learning Memory**

- **Remembers experiences** and learns from them
- **Builds knowledge** that improves over time
- **Recalls relevant information** when making decisions
- **Consolidates patterns** from specific cases to general principles

### üîç **Self-Monitoring**

- **Checks its own reasoning** for quality and biases
- **Provides confidence levels** for transparency
- **Suggests improvements** to its own thinking
- **Adapts approach** based on problem complexity

### ‚ö° **Production Ready**

- **789 comprehensive tests** with 79.63% coverage
- **Multiple thinking modes** for different scenarios
- **Configurable behavior** for your specific needs
- **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keyurgolani/ThoughtMcp.git
cd ThoughtMcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and start the server
npm run build
npm start

# Run comprehensive demo (in another terminal)
npm run example:demo

# Or run performance benchmarks
npm run example:benchmark
```

### ü§ñ **Use in Your AI Environment**

ThoughtMCP works with popular AI development environments:

- **[Kiro IDE](docs/integration/agentic-environments.md#kiro-ide)** - Workspace and user-level configuration
- **[Claude Desktop](docs/integration/agentic-environments.md#claude-desktop)** - Desktop app integration
- **[Cursor IDE](docs/integration/agentic-environments.md#cursor-ide)** - VS Code-based AI coding
- **[Void Editor](docs/integration/agentic-environments.md#void-editor)** - Modern AI editor
- **[Generic MCP](docs/integration/agentic-environments.md#generic-mcp-configuration)** - Any MCP-compatible system

**Quick Kiro Setup:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thought-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/ThoughtMcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "COGNITIVE_DEFAULT_MODE": "balanced",
        "COGNITIVE_ENABLE_EMOTION": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Try Your First Example

Ask ThoughtMCP to help with a decision:

```json
{
  "tool": "think",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "I'm trying to decide between two job offers. One pays more but has longer hours, the other has better work-life balance but lower pay. How should I approach this decision?",
    "mode": "deliberative"
  }
}
```

**What happens:**

- Analyzes your question systematically
- Considers multiple factors and perspectives
- Provides structured reasoning with confidence levels
- Suggests ways to improve the decision-making process

### 3. Build Knowledge Over Time

Store important insights:

```json
{
  "tool": "remember",
  "arguments": {
    "content": "When choosing between job offers, work-life balance often matters more than salary for long-term satisfaction",
    "type": "semantic",
    "importance": 0.8
  }
}
```

Recall relevant knowledge:

```json
{
  "tool": "recall",
  "arguments": {
    "cue": "job decision work-life balance"
  }
}
```

## The Four Thinking Tools

### üß† **Think** - Systematic Reasoning

Process complex questions using human-like reasoning:

- **Intuitive mode**: Fast, gut-reaction responses
- **Deliberative mode**: Slow, careful analysis
- **Creative mode**: Innovative problem-solving
- **Analytical mode**: Logical, data-driven reasoning

### üíæ **Remember** - Build Knowledge

Store experiences and insights for future use:

- **Episodic memory**: Specific experiences and events
- **Semantic memory**: General knowledge and principles
- **Importance weighting**: Prioritize what matters most
- **Emotional tagging**: Remember how things felt

### üîç **Recall** - Find Relevant Information

Retrieve past experiences and knowledge when needed:

- **Similarity matching**: Find related experiences
- **Context-aware**: Consider current situation
- **Confidence scoring**: Know how relevant results are
- **Cross-memory search**: Search both experience and knowledge

### üî¨ **Analyze Reasoning** - Quality Control

Check thinking quality and identify potential problems:

- **Bias detection**: Spot common reasoning errors
- **Logic validation**: Ensure arguments are sound
- **Confidence assessment**: Evaluate certainty levels
- **Improvement suggestions**: Get better at reasoning
