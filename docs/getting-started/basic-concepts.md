# Basic Concepts

This guide explains the core concepts behind ThoughtMCP in simple terms. No cognitive science background required!

## The Big Picture

Think of ThoughtMCP as upgrading an AI from a simple calculator to a thoughtful advisor. Instead of just processing text once, it thinks about problems the way humans do.

## How Human Thinking Works (Simplified)

To understand ThoughtMCP, it helps to know how human thinking works:

### 1. We Have Two Thinking Systems

**System 1 (Fast Thinking)**

- Automatic and intuitive
- Like recognizing a friend's face instantly
- Good for familiar situations
- Can make mistakes with complex problems

**System 2 (Slow Thinking)**

- Deliberate and careful
- Like solving a math problem step-by-step
- Good for complex decisions
- Takes more time and energy

**ThoughtMCP Example:**

```json
{
  "tool": "think",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "Should I buy this stock?",
    "mode": "intuitive" // Uses System 1 - fast gut reaction
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "think",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "Should I buy this stock?",
    "mode": "deliberative" // Uses System 2 - careful analysis
  }
}
```

### 2. We Learn from Experience

Humans have two types of memory:

**Episodic Memory** - Specific experiences

- "Last Tuesday, I had a great meeting with the client"
- "The last time I tried this approach, it failed"

**Semantic Memory** - General knowledge

- "Meetings work better when prepared"
- "This type of approach usually fails because..."

**ThoughtMCP Example:**

```json
{
  "tool": "remember",
  "arguments": {
    "content": "Yesterday's client meeting went well because I prepared an agenda",
    "type": "episodic" // Specific experience
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "remember",
  "arguments": {
    "content": "Client meetings are more effective with prepared agendas",
    "type": "semantic" // General principle
  }
}
```

### 3. We Check Our Own Thinking

Humans naturally monitor their own reasoning:

- "Am I being biased here?"
- "Did I consider all the options?"
- "How confident am I in this conclusion?"

**ThoughtMCP Example:**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      {
        "type": "assumption",
        "content": "The market will continue growing",
        "confidence": 0.6
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The Seven ThoughtMCP Tools

### Core Cognitive Tools

### üß† Think Tool

**What it does:** Processes questions using human-like reasoning

**Think of it like:** Having a thoughtful advisor who can switch between quick intuition and careful analysis

**Modes:**

- `intuitive` - Fast, gut-reaction responses
- `deliberative` - Slow, careful analysis
- `balanced` - Mix of both (default)
- `creative` - Emphasizes novel connections
- `analytical` - Emphasizes logical reasoning

**Example:**

```json
{
  "tool": "think",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "My team is struggling with deadlines. What should I do?",
    "mode": "deliberative",
    "enable_emotion": true,
    "enable_metacognition": true
  }
}
```

**Response includes:**

- Systematic analysis of the problem
- Multiple perspectives considered
- Confidence level in the reasoning
- Suggestions for improvement

### üíæ Remember Tool

**What it does:** Stores experiences and knowledge for future use

**Think of it like:** Writing in a smart journal that organizes information automatically

**Types:**

- `episodic` - Specific experiences and events
- `semantic` - General knowledge and principles

**Example:**

```json
{
  "tool": "remember",
  "arguments": {

    "importance": 0.8,
    "emotional_tags": ["success", "teamwork"]
  }
}
```

**What happens:**

- Information is stored with context
- Emotional significance is noted
- Importance level affects how long it's remembered
- Can be recalled later when relevant

### üîç Recall Tool

  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      {
        "type": "causal_inference",
        "content": "Poor communication causes missed deadlines",
        "confidence": 0.7,
        "alternatives": ["Resource constraints", "Unclear requirements"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
