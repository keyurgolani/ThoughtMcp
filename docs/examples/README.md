```bash
# Run provided example scripts
npm run example:customer-support
npm run example:finance-advisor
```

**Option 3: Interactive Mode**

```bash
# Start interactive mode for experimentation
npm run interactive
```

Use simple examples as building blocks for complex applications.

### Focus on Patterns

Look for reusable patterns you can apply to your problems.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I modify these examples?**
A: Yes! All examples are designed to be adapted and extended.

**Q: Do I need to understand cognitive science?**
A: No. Examples explain concepts in practical terms.

**Q: How do I know which thinking mode to use?**
A: Start with "balanced" mode, then experiment with others based on your needs.

**Q: Can I combine multiple examples?**
A: Absolutely. Many real-world applications combine patterns from multiple examples.

**Q: What if an example doesn't work for my use case?**
A: Check the integration examples for different implementation approaches, or ask in our discussions.
