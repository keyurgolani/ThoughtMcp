## The Scenario

You want to improve the quality of reasoning and decision-making by identifying biases, logical flaws, and areas for improvement. This is like having a reasoning coach that helps you think better.

## Basic Reasoning Analysis

### Analyzing Your Own Reasoning

**Scenario**: You've made a decision and want to check if your reasoning was sound.

**Your Reasoning Steps:**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      {
        "type": "problem_identification",
        "content": "Our website is loading slowly, affecting user experience",
        "confidence": 0.9
      },
      {
        "type": "cause_analysis",
        "content": "The problem is probably the database queries taking too long",
        "confidence": 0.6
      },
      {
        "type": "solution_proposal",
        "content": "We should add database indexes to speed up queries",
        "confidence": 0.8
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**What the Analysis Reveals:**

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "logical_coherence": 0.7,
    "evidence_support": 0.5,
    "bias_indicators": [
      {
        "type": "confirmation_bias",
        "severity": "moderate",
        "explanation": "Jumped to database conclusion without investigating other causes"
      }
    ],
    "reasoning_quality": "moderate",
    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "Gather performance metrics before assuming root cause",
      "Consider alternative explanations (network, frontend, CDN)",
      "Test hypothesis before implementing solution"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Analyzing Complex Decisions

**Scenario**: You're choosing between two job offers and want to check your reasoning.

**Tool Call:**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      {
        "type": "option_identification",
        "content": "I have two job offers: Company A offers $120k with remote work, Company B offers $100k but it's a startup with equity",
        "confidence": 1.0
      },
      {
        "type": "criteria_weighting",
        "content": "Salary is most important to me right now because I have student loans",
        "confidence": 0.8
      },
      {
        "type": "risk_assessment",
        "content": "Company A is safer because it's established, startups are risky",
        "confidence": 0.7
      },
      {
        "type": "decision",
        "content": "I should choose Company A because of higher salary and lower risk",
        "confidence": 0.8
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Analysis Results:**

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "logical_coherence": 0.8,
    "evidence_support": 0.6,
    "bias_indicators": [
      {
        "type": "loss_aversion",
        "severity": "mild",
        "explanation": "Overweighting risk of startup failure"
      },
      {
        "type": "anchoring_bias",
        "severity": "moderate",
        "explanation": "Anchored on salary numbers without considering total compensation"
      }
    ],
    "missing_considerations": [
      "Long-term career growth potential",
      "Learning opportunities at startup vs established company",
      "Actual equity value calculation",
      "Work-life balance differences",
      "Team and culture fit"
    ],
    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "Calculate total compensation including equity scenarios",
      "Consider 3-5 year career trajectory for each option",
      "Evaluate non-monetary factors like learning and growth",
      "Talk to current employees at both companies"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Identifying Common Biases

### Confirmation Bias

**Example Reasoning:**

```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "type": "hypothesis",
      "content": "I think our users prefer the blue button design",
      "confidence": 0.7
    },
    {
      "type": "evidence_gathering",
      "content": "I asked 3 colleagues and they all agreed blue looks better",
      "confidence": 0.8
    },
    {
      "type": "conclusion",
      "content": "Blue button is definitely the right choice",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Identifies:**

- **Confirmation bias**: Only sought confirming evidence
- **Small sample size**: 3 colleagues isn't representative
- **Selection bias**: Colleagues may have similar preferences
- **Missing A/B testing**: No actual user data

### Anchoring Bias

**Example Reasoning:**

```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "type": "initial_estimate",
      "content": "The client mentioned their budget is around $50k for this project",
      "confidence": 0.8
    },
    {
      "type": "scope_analysis",
      "content": "Looking at the requirements, this seems like a $50k project",
      "confidence": 0.7
    },
    {
      "type": "pricing_decision",
      "content": "I'll quote $48k to be competitive",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Identifies:**

- **Anchoring bias**: Influenced by client's initial number
- **Insufficient analysis**: Didn't independently estimate effort
- **Undervaluing work**: May be pricing below actual value

### Availability Heuristic

**Example Reasoning:**

```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "type": "risk_assessment",
      "content": "Cloud services are unreliable because AWS had that big outage last month",
      "confidence": 0.8
    },
    {
      "type": "solution_preference",
      "content": "We should host everything on our own servers for reliability",
      "confidence": 0.7
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Identifies:**

- **Availability heuristic**: Recent dramatic event skewing perception
- **Incomplete data**: Not considering overall reliability statistics
- **False comparison**: Own servers may be less reliable than cloud

## Improving Reasoning Quality

### Before Making Important Decisions

**Step 1: Document Your Reasoning**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      // Your reasoning steps here
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Review the Analysis**

Look for:

- Identified biases
- Missing considerations
- Weak evidence
- Logical gaps

**Step 3: Improve Your Reasoning**

Address the identified issues:

- Gather missing evidence
- Consider alternative perspectives
- Challenge your assumptions
- Seek disconfirming evidence

### Iterative Improvement

**Round 1: Initial Reasoning**

```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "type": "problem_analysis",
      "content": "Our app crashes frequently, users are complaining",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "type": "solution",
      "content": "We need to hire more developers to fix bugs faster",
      "confidence": 0.7
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Result**: "Jumping to solution without root cause analysis"

**Round 2: Improved Reasoning**

```json
{
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "type": "problem_analysis",
      "content": "Our app crashes frequently, users are complaining",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "type": "data_gathering",
      "content": "Crash logs show 80% of crashes are from one specific feature",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "type": "root_cause_analysis",
      "content": "The feature has a memory leak that wasn't caught in testing",
      "confidence": 0.8
    },
    {
      "type": "solution_evaluation",
      "content": "Fix the memory leak and improve testing process to catch similar issues",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Result**: "Much improved - data-driven approach with root cause analysis"

## Advanced Analysis Features

### Confidence Calibration

**Tool Call:**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      {
        "type": "prediction",
        "content": "This marketing campaign will increase sales by 25%",
        "confidence": 0.9
      }
    ],
    "context": {
      "domain": "marketing",
      "check_confidence_calibration": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Analysis Checks:**

- Is 90% confidence justified?
- What evidence supports this confidence level?
- Are you overconfident based on past predictions?

### Alternative Perspective Analysis

**Tool Call:**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      // Your reasoning steps
    ],
    "context": {
      "generate_alternatives": true,
      "perspective_count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

**Analysis Provides:**

- Alternative interpretations of the evidence
- Different solution approaches
- Contrarian viewpoints to consider

    }
  ]
}
```

**Common Issues:**

- Single-factor optimization
