## Key Features

### üß† Human-Like Cognitive Processing

- **Dual-Process Thinking**: System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) processing
- **Memory Systems**: Episodic and semantic memory with consolidation
- **Emotional Processing**: Somatic markers and emotional modulation
- **Metacognitive Monitoring**: Self-awareness and bias detection

### üîß Eight Cognitive Tools

#### Core Cognitive Tools

1. **`think`** - Process input through cognitive architecture
2. **`remember`** - Store information in memory systems
3. **`recall`** - Retrieve memories based on cues
4. **`analyze_reasoning`** - Analyze reasoning for quality and biases

#### Advanced Reasoning Tools

5. **`analyze_systematically`** - Apply proven thinking frameworks automatically
6. **`think_parallel`** - Multi-stream reasoning with conflict resolution
7. **`decompose_problem`** - Break complex problems into manageable components
8. **`think_probabilistic`** - Bayesian reasoning with uncertainty quantification

### üéØ Processing Modes

- **Intuitive**: Fast pattern matching for familiar problems
- **Deliberative**: Slow, careful reasoning for complex issues
- **Creative**: High variability for innovation and brainstorming
- **Analytical**: Structured reasoning for technical problems
- **Balanced**: Adaptive processing that switches modes as needed

### üìä Performance Features

- **Configurable Parameters**: Tune for speed vs. quality trade-offs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and health checks
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for concurrent sessions and horizontal scaling

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start

# Run examples (in another terminal)
npm run example:demo
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

// Connect to ThoughtMCP server
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "node",
  args: ["dist/index.js"],
});

const client = new Client({ name: "my-app", version: "1.0.0" }, {});
await client.connect(transport);

// Use cognitive thinking
const result = await client.request({
  method: "tools/call",
  params: {
    name: "think",
    arguments: {
      input: "What are the implications of quantum computing?",
      mode: "deliberative",
    },
  },
});

console.log(result.content.content);
```

## Architecture Overview

ThoughtMCP implements a sophisticated cognitive architecture inspired by neuroscience and cognitive psychology:

    Input[Input] --> SP[Sensory Processor]
    SP --> WM[Working Memory]
    WM --> DP[Dual Process Controller]
    DP --> S1[System 1 - Intuitive]
    DP --> S2[System 2 - Deliberative]
    S1 --> SNP[Stochastic Neural Processor]
    S2 --> SNP
    SNP --> EP[Executive Processor]
    EP --> MC[Metacognition Module]
    MC --> Output[Thought Output]

    MS --> SM[Semantic Memory]
    MS --> CE[Consolidation Engine]

    WM <--> MS

```

### Core Components

1. **Sensory Processing**: Filters and normalizes input information
2. **Working Memory**: Temporarily holds and manipulates information
3. **Dual-Process Controller**: Manages intuitive vs. deliberative thinking
4. **Memory Systems**: Stores and retrieves episodic and semantic memories
5. **Emotional Processing**: Adds emotional context and somatic markers
6. **Metacognitive Monitoring**: Self-monitors reasoning quality and biases
7. **Predictive Processing**: Generates predictions and updates models
8. **Stochastic Neural Processing**: Adds biological-like variability
