# ThoughtMCP Documentation

Welcome to ThoughtMCP - an AI system that thinks more like humans do.

## What is ThoughtMCP?

ThoughtMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI systems human-like thinking capabilities. Instead of just processing text, it can:

- **Think systematically** about complex problems
- **Remember experiences** and learn from them
- **Recall relevant information** when making decisions
- **Check its own reasoning** for quality and biases

Think of it as upgrading an AI from a simple calculator to a thoughtful advisor.

## What Makes ThoughtMCP Different?

Most AI systems process text in a single pass. ThoughtMCP implements multiple thinking systems inspired by cognitive science:

- **Dual-Process Thinking**: Fast intuitive responses + careful deliberation
- **Memory Systems**: Learns from experience like humans do
- **Emotional Processing**: Considers emotional context in decisions
- **Self-Monitoring**: Checks its own reasoning quality

## Quick Example

```json
{
  "tool": "think",
  "arguments": {
    "input": "Should I invest in renewable energy stocks?",
    "mode": "deliberative"
  }
}
```

ThoughtMCP will:

1. Analyze the question systematically
2. Recall relevant financial knowledge
3. Consider multiple perspectives
4. Check its reasoning quality
5. Provide a thoughtful response with confidence levels

## Project Status
