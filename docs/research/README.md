## Overview

ThoughtMCP is grounded in decades of cognitive science research, implementing computational models of human thinking processes. This section provides the academic foundation for understanding why and how the system works.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Dual-Process Theory

**Foundation**: Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" and decades of cognitive psychology research.

**Research Validation**:

- Response time patterns match human dual-process behavior
- Accuracy vs. speed trade-offs align with psychological research
- Conflict resolution mechanisms based on empirical studies

### 2. Memory Systems

**Foundation**: Tulving's episodic/semantic memory distinction and Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model.

**Implementation**:

- **Episodic Memory**: Specific experiences with temporal and contextual tags
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge with associative networks
- **Consolidation**: Transfer from episodic to semantic over time

**Research Validation**:

- Memory retrieval patterns match human recall curves
- Consolidation timing aligns with sleep research
- Forgetting curves follow Ebbinghaus patterns

### 3. Working Memory
